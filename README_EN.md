## Topic

The project topic is a gym management system.

## System Description

### 1. Basic Information about the System

The gym management system aims to efficiently manage memberships, class bookings, and customer service in the gym. The system allows clients to purchase memberships, manage them, and reserve spots for classes. Trainers can organize classes, book rooms, and communicate with clients. Staff can verify memberships and manage customer data, while managers can oversee personnel.

### 2. Description of the Modeled Reality

The system consists of the following entities:

- **Membership** - a document granting the client access to the gym. The membership specifies the time window during which it is valid, personal details of the owner, payment information, and contact details. It is also used to track the days and times when the user was present at the gym facility.
- **Training Room** - a space where training sessions occur. It is used for sports activities. Each room has a unique number, equipment, and a maximum capacity of people allowed at the same time.
- **Classes** - represent a reserved time slot during which group exercises take place. Classes are described by the time and date when they occur, the room in which they are held, the trainers leading them, and the clients participating.

### 3. Outline of System Users

###### Users:

1. Client
2. Trainer
3. Staff
4. Manager

###### 3.1. Client

Each client has a membership they can manage, can sign up for classes, and can consult with a trainer.

###### 3.2. Trainer

Trainers can reserve training rooms, manage classes, and communicate with clients.

###### 3.3. Staff

Staff can issue and modify clients' memberships.

###### 3.4. Manager

Managers can oversee staff, rooms, and can also use the system like other staff members (e.g., managing user memberships).

### 4. Description of System Functionality

###### Functionalities:

1. Purchasing a membership
2. Cancelling a membership
3. Renewing a membership
4. Changing data on the membership
5. Signing clients up for classes
6. Organizing classes by trainers
7. Canceling classes by trainers
8. Managing rooms

###### 4.1. Purchasing a Membership

The user must request a staff member to set up a membership. They will need to provide personal information, payment method, and select the type of membership.

###### 4.2. Cancelling a Membership

Staff cancels the membership upon the user's request. The user provides their personal information for this purpose.

###### 4.3. Renewing a Membership

If the membership is not canceled, it will automatically renew without the need for user interaction.

###### 4.4. Managing Memberships

The user approaches a staff member, who edits the data associated with the membership. The client must specify which data they wish to change, and the staff must verify if the change is possible.

###### 4.5. Signing Clients Up for Classes

Clients have access to the scheduled classes and can freely sign up for them.

###### 4.6. Organizing Classes by Trainers

Trainers enter the planned date and time of the classes, their type, and the room number into the system.

###### 4.7. Canceling Classes by Trainers

Trainers remove information about previously scheduled classes from the system.

###### 4.8. Managing Rooms

Managers establish which rooms are in use and can be reserved for classes, and which require maintenance.

### 5. Description of Non-Functional Requirements of the System

The system is multi-platform: all users can access the system via a website, and clients and trainers can interact with the system through a mobile application. It is also easily scalable and resistant to significant resource load, prepared to handle a large number of users. Authorization is conducted using secure authentication methods, including two-factor verification for staff and managers. The interface is intuitive and responsive, with navigation optimized for accessibility for all users.

## Glossary
- Membership - the client's identifier in the system, authorizing access to the gym. A membership can be purchased, canceled, transferred to another client, or have its data changed.

- Client - the primary user of the system. The client can purchase and manage a membership, sign up for classes, and communicate with trainers.
- Trainer - a person responsible for organizing training classes and consulting with clients.
- Staff - a system user authorizing operations related to managing clients' memberships.
- Manager - a person managing staff, memberships, and rooms in the system.
